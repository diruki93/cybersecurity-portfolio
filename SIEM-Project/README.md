## 🎯 Objective
Build a mini Security Operations Center (SOC) using Splunk to analyze logs and detect threats.

## 🛡 Tools Used
- Splunk Free Edition
- Windows Event Logs
- Sysmon

## 📝 Process
1. Installed Splunk and ingested Windows logs.
2. Configured Sysmon for detailed event logging.
3. Created Splunk queries to detect failed logins and suspicious processes.
4. Built dashboards for real-time monitoring.

## 📸 Screenshots
(Add Splunk dashboard and query screenshots here in `./screenshots/`)

## ✅ Key Findings
- Multiple failed login attempts (brute-force simulation).
- Suspicious PowerShell execution.
- Configured alerts for monitoring.

## 📌 Outcome
Demonstrated log analysis, threat detection, and SIEM monitoring in a simulated SOC.
